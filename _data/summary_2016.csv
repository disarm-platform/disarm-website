YES,"Codename ""DOUMA""","Universal, offline, multi-device application: works with and without network, on desktop and tablet and mobile. The aim is to make this a place where all the interactions with DiSARM can take place - including IRS, foci investigation, etc. Name to be decided.",1 - active development,"douma-meta,douma-foci-gif",Y,Y,http://duma-stage.surge.sh
YES,Pipeline-R (and dashboard),"The component which models malaria risk from case locations and environmental data, and generates a range of outputs for further use, including risk maps. Includes a graphical admin interface to make it simple to see what is happening, what maps have been created, what data is needed, etc. Designed to be installed on a server in-country, and to be managed by each NMCP.",1 - active development,DiSARM_Pipeline_3,N,N,https://davesteps.shinyapps.io/pipeline-r/
YES,Google EarthEngine Imagery Export Scripts,"Manages a regular export of environmental data from Google Earth Engine, packaging the information so it's readily available for each country pipeline to use in the generation of risk models and maps. This runs on one remote server which does the processing for all countries.",1 - active development,kfkhldiie5eph1dcqn0g.png ,N,,just code
YES,Core Interface,"The original interface designed to make it easy to view and explore the outputs from the DiSARM pipeline. Customised for Swaziland and for Zimbabwe/Mat-South, it contains a timeline which allows you to navigate through time, viewing the risk map and data for any given month.",1 - active development,,,,http://swz-core.disarm.io
YES,API Documentation,Documentation for developers to use to incorporate DiSARM outputs in any client applications.,1 - active development,lc9mlysawoqzsjot8inm,,,docs.disarm.io
YES,IRS Targeter For Swaziland,"Dynamic risk-based locality prioritisation tool, with custom geospatial editing functionality. Being integrated into DOUMA",1 - active development,,,,https://ppls.shinyapps.io/targeting_demo_SWZ/
YES,DiSARM-Jekyll,"Project website. Designed to be fast to load in low-bandwidth locations, requires no servers or ongoing costs to host, and is (relatively!) simple to update either using online tools or using a completely offline version (for upload later).",1 - active development,website-tour-gif,Y,,http://www.disarm.io/
YES,Structure Clusterer,"Demonstation of an interactive tool to create clusters of structures based on risk and structure locations, for example for use in IRS targeting.",2 - concept or prototype,,Y,,HS

YES,DHIS2-DiSARM App,"A simple DHIS2 ""app"" demonstrating the use of DiSARM outputs within DHIS2.",2 - concept or prototype,hovek5brofa4dzl4pkss,Y,,
YES,API Viewer,"An admin interface for debugging the outputs from DiSARM. Some similarity to the 'Core interface', but without the design and performance improvements.",2 - concept or prototype,,,,HS
YES,IRS Maps For Swaziland,"A set of 150 static, paper-based PDF maps for Swaziland - one for each of the prioritised localities for spraying. Showing cluster of structures - no more than 50 in a group, and no more than 250m apart.",2 - concept or prototype,creation_of_risk_maps,N,,static map
YES,Clicker App & Dashboard,"Demonstration of a live-updating dashboard from field data collection tool. Could be used to track e.g. IRS progress, and identify gaps in real-time to improve mop-up targeting. Functionality is being integrated into DOUMA.",3 - not being developed,DiSARM_Clicker_App,,,HS
YES,Offline Form Concept,"Proof-of-concept of an offline tool data collection tool which includes ability to explicitly identify spatial entities (e.g. structures), and add data directly to them.",3 - not being developed,kozjkaqpxpe6xrptryqw,,,https://disarm-form.surge.sh/
