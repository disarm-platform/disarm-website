In Swaziland, the surveillance and decision support platform was utilised to create an automated intervention mapping process, which was done by hand in previous years.

The platform was used to support the 2016 annual process for prioritising areas for indoor-residual spraying activity. The automation of the intervention mapping process resulted in the development of digital maps being put into the hands of decision-makers, enabling them to take action based on the information they displayed.

Prioritisation was scheduled according to the various localities inherent in the Kingdom of Swaziland called Tinkhundla. 150 localities were selected from a total of 500, enabling the team to automate the algorithm traditionally used to select localities at sufficiently high risk to warrant spraying.

The platform took into account the disease surveillance data from local health facilities as well as local satellite derived environmental and climatological variables to produce clusters of structures to be targeted. Each cluster includes 50 structures located no more than 250m apart.

150 custom maps were presented to the Swaziland National Malaria Control Program in time to help them inform their prioritisation strategies for the 2016 annual indoor-residual spraying activity.
